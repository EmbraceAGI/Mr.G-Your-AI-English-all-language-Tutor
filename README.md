# Mr.Gee: Your Personalized AI Language Learning Bot 🤖

❤ If you like this bot, and you want to try more experimental funcition. You can find newset version and try it on my Blog

[Click here](https://www.garyhou2023.info) 🖱  <br>

## I. What is Mr.Gee? 🧐

Mr.Gee is a combination of a series of prompts 🤖, designed to help you remember complex words, analyze and deconstruct long difficult sentences, and assess the structure of articles 🌐.

There's a Hamlet in the eyes of a thousand individuals. Likewise, there should be a thousand different word books in the eyes of a thousand people, each with their own unique book of words.

Traditional word books are stereotyped, with English words on the left and native language explanations on the right. However, the long-term consequence of this is a low sensitivity to English. Naturally, the brain would be slower with an English-Chinese-English pathway, so the most effective way is to learn English in English.

But how could a person with a TOEFL score of 50 and one with a score of 100 use the exact same word explanations to learn? The advantage of Mr.Gee is that it generates word explanations and word memory cards that are tailored to your actual English level and your preferred style of explanation.

Imagine the efficiency boost for a student who likes science fiction novels and another who prefers romance novels if they could learn word explanations and examples in their favorite styles.

For difficult sentences that you don't understand, Mr.Gee can perform deconstructions. Once you're familiar with the symbols, you can directly understand the structure of any complex sentences without needing a tutor to help you analyze them.

By building your own personalized word book📖 based on your accumulated words, it guarantees a personalized and engaging learning journey 🎒. You can self-study any language using Mr.Gee through Chat-GPT/Bing/Bard/Claude.

(How Mr.Gee corrects your pronunciation and performs article deconstruction is still in experimentation)
