## Requirements 🛠

To get started, you'll need:

- Note-taking tools: Anki, Notion, or Obsidian (highly recommended). You can also use other platforms like OneNote if you prefer 🗒.
- AI bots: ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 3.5 (Turbo or Claude+), Midjourney, or Firefly(wait) 🤖.

## Mechanism 🧩

Our language learning approach consists of two methods:

1. Using Language E (English) to learn E (English) 🇬🇧
2. Using Language C (Chinese) or D (Dutch) to learn E (English) 🇨🇳🇳🇱

The first method might seem slow, but it proves to be a powerful tool as you master it 💪. Our goal is to aid you in this approach, leveraging Midjourney and Firefly to generate complex nouns and enhancing your language comprehension 🎓.

## How It Works 🛠

You feed your desired language learning prompts to the AI bots, and they produce a series of complex nouns. Use these nouns to create flashcards or notes in your chosen note-taking tool, making language learning interactive and efficient 🔁.
