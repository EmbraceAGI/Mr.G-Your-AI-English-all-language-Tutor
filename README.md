## Requirements

To get started, you will need the following tools:

- Note-taking tools: Anki, Notion, or Obsidian (highly recommended). However, you can also use other platforms like OneNote based on your preference.
- AI bots: ChatGPT 4, ChatGPT 3.5 (Turbo or Claude+), Midjourney, or Firefly.

## Mechanism

Our language learning approach can be categorized into two methods:

1. Using Language E (English) to learn E (English)
2. Using Language C (Chinese) or D (Dutch) to learn E (English)

While the first method might seem slow initially, it proves to be highly effective and powerful once you start to master it. Therefore, the aim of this prompt project is to assist you in using English to learn English.

We leverage the capabilities of Midjourney and Firefly to generate complex nouns, thereby enhancing your vocabulary and understanding of the language.

## How It Works

The process is simple and straightforward. You input your desired language learning prompts into the AI bots, which then generate a series of complex nouns. These nouns can be used to create flashcards or notes in your chosen note-taking tool. This method allows you to actively engage with the language, making the learning process more interactive and effective.

gpt3.5: (normal prompt)

Meaning: Vehement refers to a strong and intense emotion or conviction, often shown in an impassioned manner. It can also refer to something that is marked by forceful energy or intensity.

Pronunciation: /ˈviːəmənt/ (VEE-uh-muhnt)

Example: The politician delivered a vehement speech to rally his supporters.

Synonyms: passionate, intense, forceful, fervent, ardent, emphatic.

Remember: To remember the word "vehement", think of it as "ve-he-men-t" where "ve" can mean very, "he" refers to the intense emotion, and "men" refers to the forceful energy. This can help you remember the meaning of the word as having strong and intense emotion or forceful energy.

GPT4: (Improved prompt)

**Meaning:** "Vehement" describes something marked by intense force or emotion. It implies strong feeling or fervor and often signifies passionate disagreement.
**Pronunciation:** VEE-uh-muhnt
**Example:** His vehement denial of the accusations surprised everyone at the board meeting.
**Mnemonic:** Picture a vehicle moving with extreme force and intensity, just like the intensity of the emotions associated with something being vehement. So, **Vehicle Meant (for intensity)** = **Vehement**.
**Family:**
Passionate / Fierce / Intense / Vigorous / Forceful / Heated
**Estimation:** ★★★☆☆

GPT3.5: (improved promt)

**Meaning:** It describes a powerful and intense display of feeling or conviction, often characterized by a forceful expression or action.

**Pronunciation:** VEE-uh-muhnt.

**Example:** His vehement objection to the proposal made it clear that he was not in favor of it.

**Mnemonic:**

Expert 1: "The 'veh' in vehement sounds like 'vehicle' to me."

Expert 2: "Ok, and 'ment' sounds like 'mental'."

Expert 3: "So maybe we can think of it as a strong and powerful 'vehicle' driving someone's 'mental' state, like an intense emotion or conviction that is hard to control."

Expert 1: "Or we can imagine someone using a powerful vehicle, like a bulldozer, to express their feelings in a forceful way."

Expert 2: "I like that. So we can picture someone using a bulldozer to push their way through obstacles, just like how a vehement person might push their point across."

You see, it can make you use GPT3.5 to remember vocabularies like GPT4!!
