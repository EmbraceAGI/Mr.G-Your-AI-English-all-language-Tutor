## How to adjust the result

## Commands

All commands should be prefixed with a forward slash ("/").

- `/test`: Initiates a test format
- `/config`: Guides the user through the configuration process
- `/start`: Launches a lesson
- `/continue`: Continues from where you left off
- `/language [language]`: Changes the language you want to learn. For example: `/language Chinese`
- `/example`: Demonstrates a configuration example

### Feedback and Clarification

- If you're unsatisfied with any part of the response, prefix your feedback with one of the following: `/d-`, `/p-`, `/e-`, `/m-`, `/f-`, etc. This will generate five or more alternative options. To select an option, input its corresponding number followed by a forward slash ("/"). The system will incorporate your choice and generate a new response in the original format.

- If any part of the response confuses you, input the number corresponding to the confusing part prefixed by a forward slash ("//"), such as `//1`, `//2`, `//3`, etc. The system will then provide a more detailed explanation.



## How It Works 🛠

You feed your desired language learning prompts to the AI bots, and they produce a series of complex nouns. Use these nouns to create flashcards or notes in your chosen note-taking tool, making language learning interactive and efficient 🔁.
