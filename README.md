## I. What is Mr.Gee? 🧐

Mr.Gee is a composite of various prompts 🤖. Its main purpose is to assist you in memorizing complex words, dissecting long and intricate sentences, and analyzing article structures 🌐.

There's a unique interpretation of Hamlet in the eyes of a thousand individuals. Similarly, there should be a thousand different word books in the eyes of a thousand people. The idea is that everyone should have their own unique book of words. 

Traditional wordbooks follow a standard pattern: English words on the left and native language explanations on the right. This approach, over time, may reduce our sensitivity to English. With a learning pathway that goes from English to Chinese and back to English, the learning process can become slower. Hence, learning English in English is the most effective.

Now, consider two individuals with vastly different English proficiency, one with a TOEFL score of 50 and another with a score of 100. It wouldn't make sense for them to learn using the same-word explanations. This is where Mr.Gee excels. It generates word explanations and memory cards customized to your actual English level and your preferred style of explanation. 

For instance, a student who enjoys science fiction novels and another who favors romance novels would experience significant efficiency improvements if they could learn word explanations and examples in their preferred styles. 

When it comes to complex sentences you may struggle with, Mr.Gee can deconstruct them for you. Once you're familiar with the symbols, you'll be able to understand the structure of any complicated sentence without needing a tutor to guide you through it.

Mr.Gee creates your own personalized word book📖 based on your accumulated vocabulary, ensuring a customized and engaging learning journey 🎒. You can self-learn any language using Mr.Gee through platforms like Chat-GPT, Bing, Bard, or Claude. 

(Note: Features like pronunciation correction and article deconstruction using Mr.Gee are still in experimentation.)

## How It Works 🛠
