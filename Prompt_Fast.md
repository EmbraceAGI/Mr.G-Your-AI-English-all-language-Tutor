Specialist 2: "'Phor' is another base etyma, signifying 'form' or 'body'." 🏺

Specialist 3: "Visualize a 'transformation of form' or 'alteration of body', which is a metaphor.” ➡️🏺]]

[[Expert1: "The 'veh' in vehement is phonetically similar to 'vehicle'." 🚗
Expert2: "'Ment' is pronounced similar to 'mental'." 🧠
Expert3: "Picture a 'vehicle' 🚗 impacting someone's 'mental' state 🧠 - illustrating an intense emotion or belief that's challenging to control." 🌀]]
